# MoveFast FrontEnd Technical Test

Hi there, here's a brief a description of my solution to the technical test.

To run the webserver, run

```
npm start
```

This project was created by the `create-react-app` tool, so almost all files are generated by the tool itself. The only
exceptions are `App.css` and `App.tsx`.

The test is straightforward so there's not much further I want to explain here, except for two small notes:

1. The elements are structured using CSS grids, but I've decided to not go too overboard with it since it's a bit
   overkill.
2. I've only taken the colours as shown in the problem description. The boxes are created from such colours, which means
   they are dependent on the colours themselves. So if we add more colours we will end up with unwanted boxes, so separate
   between the colours and the boxes and have some sort of mapping function to assign a colour to each box may be favoured
   in a bigger project. Here I just chose the former approach since it's simpler.

## Why is the desktop version so small?

Since I reckon the main goal of the test is to simply recreate the UI, I have decided to not put too much time into
proper UI scaling.

# The end

That's all. Should this document not be sufficient, I'll be happy to answer any question you may have. Thank you for
reading :)
